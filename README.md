# Atom-DB.-SQL-like-DB.

Some 2000 LOC of C code. SQL like DB.

Main features:

- basic but smart design.
- any number of tables and columns.
- Indexes memory resident.
- the code is C and is easy to read and understand.
- the code is really tested.
- the code is secure and fast.
- the code is very easy to extent.

I think is good start point for any DBMS proyect.
